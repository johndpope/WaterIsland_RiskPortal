THE QUICK PITCH: i still like it, think its very undervalued, but just not an easy one to pitch, b/c you know top line contracts this year and flat at best in 2019, so this has morphed into a longer term turnaround story.

1) i don`t believe that the company isn`t for sale.  I just think they don`t want to create more animosity with Fuji and end up having them threaten the supply chain.  So i think everything on the table and they just trying to set the stage for a world where they don`t have to rely on Fuji to manufacture for them
2) The company reiterated FCF guide and basically told you it was conservative, which was always my view.  They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.
6) Tailrisk is around Fuji deciding to play games with the supply chain (which hurts Fuji as well, so would be mutual destruction).  This is what took the stock to $23-$24 imo.  Upside is obviously if they execute any sort of M&A","Fundamental Downside: $3.50, low of analyst NTM EPS (ex outlier) at 6.37x, which is the downside standard deviation implied of the median discount at which XRX has historically traded to HPQ.

THE QUICK PITCH: i still like it, think its very undervalued, but just not an easy one to pitch, b/c you know top line contracts this year and flat at best in 2019, so this has morphed into a longer term turnaround story.

1) i don`t believe that the company isn`t for sale.  I just think they don`t want to create more animosity with Fuji and end up having them threaten the supply chain.  So i think everything on the table and they just trying to set the stage for a world where they don`t have to rely on Fuji to manufacture for them
2) The company reiterated FCF guide and basically told you it was conservative, which was always my view.  They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.
6) Tailrisk is around Fuji deciding to play games with the supply chain (which hurts Fuji as well, so would be mutual destruction).  This is what took the stock to $23-$24 imo.

So i think everything on the table and they just trying to set the stage for a world where they don`t have to rely on Fuji to manufacture for them
2) The company reiterated FCF guide and basically told you it was conservative, which was always my view.  They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.
6) Tailrisk is around Fuji deciding to play games with the supply chain (which hurts Fuji as well, so would be mutual destruction).  This is what took the stock to $23-$24 imo.  Upside is obviously if they execute any sort of M&A","Fundamental Downside: $3.50, low of analyst NTM EPS (ex outlier) at 6.37x, which is the downside standard deviation implied of the median discount at which XRX has historically traded to HPQ.  The range vs. HPQ 6.4x to 7.9x

","Pegging upside to the high end of FCF implied valuation.

Fundamental Upside: $3.56 of NTM EPS at 7.9x EPS = $28.12, which is the upside standard deviation implied of the median discount at which XRX has historically traded to HPQ.  The range vs. HPQ 6.4x to 7.9x

XRX 2018 revenue 9.831 (down 4.6%) and 2019 revenue 9.557 down 2.8%

EBITDA of 1.72n in 2018 and 1.673 in 2019 on 17.5% margins, is flat margins vs. 2017, which is very conservative relative to Project OWN, which involves a larger transformation for the company.  It also only implies 50mm of OPEX improvement in 2019 relative to 2018.

Assumes 700mm buyback in 2018 and 500 in 2019 on FCF of roughly $1bn in each year.

If I take the inverse of the HPQ implied P/E multiples the implied FCF yield is 12.7% to 15.7% vs. HPQ yield at 10%.  2019 FCF/share of $4.37 at 12.7% yield is $34.38

Strategic upside is $40 based on where Ichan and Deason said they would accept an all cash bid, but other holders would accept $35",.ESSXRX* INDEX,hpq us equity,caj us equity,ibm us equity,,,,,,.33,.33,.33,,,,,,12/04/2018,Reviewed,EV/Sales,EV/EBITDA,P/EPS,DVD yield,FCF yield,0,.333,.333,0,.333,Special Situations,Spec M&A,No
