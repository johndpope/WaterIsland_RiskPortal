THE QUICK PITCH: i still like it, think its very undervalued, but just not an easy one to pitch, b/c you know top line contracts this year and flat at best in 2019, so this has morphed into a longer term turnaround story.

1) i don`t believe that the company isn`t for sale.  I just think they don`t want to create more animosity with Fuji and end up having them threaten the supply chain.  So i think everything on the table and they just trying to set the stage for a world where they don`t have to rely on Fuji to manufacture for them
2) The company reiterated FCF guide and basically told you it was conservative, which was always my view.  They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.
6) Tailrisk is around Fuji deciding to play games with the supply chain (which hurts Fuji as well, so would be mutual destruction).  This is what took the stock to $23-$24 imo.  Upside is obviously if they execute any sort of M&A","Fundamental Downside: $3.50, low of analyst NTM EPS (ex outlier) at 6.37x, which is the downside standard deviation implied of the median discount at which XRX has historically traded to HPQ.

THE QUICK PITCH: i still like it, think its very undervalued, but just not an easy one to pitch, b/c you know top line contracts this year and flat at best in 2019, so this has morphed into a longer term turnaround story.

1) i don`t believe that the company isn`t for sale.  I just think they don`t want to create more animosity with Fuji and end up having them threaten the supply chain.  So i think everything on the table and they just trying to set the stage for a world where they don`t have to rely on Fuji to manufacture for them
2) The company reiterated FCF guide and basically told you it was conservative, which was always my view.  They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.
6) Tailrisk is around Fuji deciding to play games with the supply chain (which hurts Fuji as well, so would be mutual destruction).  This is what took the stock to $23-$24 imo.

They sandbagged the FCF originally b/c they didn`t want to show a standalone FCF guide that would be better than the year 1 pro-forma Fuji/XRX FCF.  However, its clear no one values this on FCF
3) They aren`t guiding EPS for the year and basically i think they are acknowledging given 1H 2018, they won`t hit the midpoint of their original margin guidance.  So, i`m at $3.36 for 2018 EPS and based on the non-stale estimates out there (only 4), the street is around $3.28. (Guide was $3.50 to $3.70) to start
4) CEO and team will be at Citi tech conference in September and i think it will be a good opp`t for them to re-engage the street in a more meaningful way.
5) On a NTM EPS basis i`m at $3.51 of EPS and the street at $3.41.  Given historical range of multiple vs. HPQ, probably puts this around 7.7 to 9x, so fundamental value is $26 to $32.

Strong performance in August as billings day effect unwinds
     July (the last month of 1Q) had two fewer billing days than the prior year and August (the first month of 2Q) had two more than the prior year
     Sunbelt rental revenue: July +9%, August +19%, ie 2mth average 14.5%
-	August skewed because of billing day affect but clearly, July and Aug is trending positively

      Management expect market growth of 4-6% pa for the next 4-5 years
     Lack of skilled labour is resulting in high backlogs and spreading out the recovery

    Rental rates broadly flat although difficult to measure on a consistent basis as trends vary by region, customer, equipment type (eg highlighted that Texas is tough rate environment currently but California, Florida and the Carolinas are strong)
  
      Management believe there is no supply problem in the industry
     Noted that big companies arent spending and small & medium sized companies are but they are doing it responsibly  many of this latter group are replacing very old kit and given Tier 4 equipment pricing, the volume of kit they can buy for a set amount of money is less than it was a few years ago

         Specialty business ex Oil & Gas +11% of which yield c0-1%, ie most of Specialty growth was volume driven

Strong performance in August as billings day effect unwinds
     July (the last month of 1Q) had two fewer billing days than the prior year and August (the first month of 2Q) had two more than the prior year
     Sunbelt rental revenue: July +9%, August +19%, ie 2mth average 14.5%
-	August skewed because of billing day affect but clearly, July and Aug is trending positively

      Management expect market growth of 4-6% pa for the next 4-5 years
     Lack of skilled labour is resulting in high backlogs and spreading out the recovery

    Rental rates broadly flat although difficult to measure on a consistent basis as trends vary by region, customer, equipment type (eg highlighted that Texas is tough rate environment currently but California, Florida and the Carolinas are strong)
  
      Management believe there is no supply problem in the industry
     Noted that big companies arent spending and small & medium sized companies are but they are doing it responsibly  many of this latter group are replacing very old kit and given Tier 4 equipment pricing, the volume of kit they can buy for a set amount of money is less than it was a few years ago

         Specialty business ex Oil & Gas +11% of which yield c0-1%, ie most of Specialty growth was volume driven

      Management expect market growth of 4-6% pa for the next 4-5 years
     Lack of skilled labour is resulting in high backlogs and spreading out the recovery

    Rental rates broadly flat although difficult to measure on a consistent basis as trends vary by region, customer, equipment type (eg highlighted that Texas is tough rate environment currently but California, Florida and the Carolinas are strong)
  
      Management believe there is no supply problem in the industry
     Noted that big companies arent spending and small & medium sized companies are but they are doing it responsibly  many of this latter group are replacing very old kit and given Tier 4 equipment pricing, the volume of kit they can buy for a set amount of money is less than it was a few years ago

         Specialty business ex Oil & Gas +11% of which yield c0-1%, ie most of Specialty growth was volume driven
     Oil & gas still a drag in 2Q but less than 1Q and by 2H should be minimal due to comps effect  sounds like it could inflect towards end of second half

* Ashland is expected to divest their I&S segment and BDO Marl plant in the next 6 months (expected by 2H)
* Pro forma, Ashland will be a much more focused specialty chemical company with 20% EBITDA margins and potential additional margin expansion
* An activist is in the name driving the process for cost cutting and portfolio simplification
* Should the company fail on achieving the cost cutting initiatives, there is a view that a number of parties would be interested in acquiring Ashland (especially given its smaller post divestiture size of ~$5B)
	* Croda was reported in the past as being interested in Ashland and FT Alphaville speculated that a low $90/share offer was presented and rejected (likely in a mix of cash and stock)
	* Croda has continued to express interest in Ashland in various investor meetings and is keen to do a deal, but expectations are that any process (if one were to be held) is likely to only occur post the divestiture of I&S and BDO Marl

* Ashland is expected to divest their I&S segment and BDO Marl plant in the next 6 months (expected by 2H)
* Pro forma, Ashland will be a much more focused specialty chemical company with 20% EBITDA margins and potential additional margin expansion
* An activist is in the name driving the process for cost cutting and portfolio simplification
* Should the company fail on achieving the cost cutting initiatives, there is a view that a number of parties would be interested in acquiring Ashland (especially given its smaller post divestiture size of ~$5B)
	* Croda was reported in the past as being interested in Ashland and FT Alphaville speculated that a low $90/share offer was presented and rejected (likely in a mix of cash and stock)
	* Croda has continued to express interest in Ashland in various investor meetings and is keen to do a deal, but expectations are that any process (if one were to be held) is likely to only occur post the divestiture of I&S and BDO Marl
* Based on our analysis, we believe ASH is worth ~$83.50-$86.00/share with the high end at $94.00-$96.50/share and the low-end at $72.25-$74.75/share

ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along
- Overhead cost cutting guidance is $50 million...Elliot believes $100 mln is more realistic

ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along

ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along

ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along

ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along

1774,149,2016-11-11,22,dzhang,ARNC US EQUITY,Soft,1,2018-07-13,2019-03-31,23.0,15.59,"ARNC is the downstream side of Alcoa when the company was split in two. AA remains the more commodity/cyclical upstream business.
ARNC currently operates 3 business units: Engineered Products & Solutions (EPS), Group Rolled Products (GRP), and Transportation & Construction Solutions (TCS)

EPS manufacturers high performance products for the Aerospace, commercial transportation and power generation markets. These include fastening systems, rolled rings, castings, airfoils, airframes, jet engine components and varioius other forged components. The business unit comprises of 4 segments: Arconic Power & Propulsion (airfoils for engines and gas turbines, airframe, etc), Arconic Fastening Systems & Rings (rolled rings and fastners), Arconic Forgings and Extrusions (airframe forgings, bulkheads, wing and landing gear components etc) and Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products (titanium ingots)

GRP manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products for the aerospace and auto market.

TCS produces products for the commercial transport and non-resi building and construction markets. Products include 
40% of the business is tied to the aero production cycle...30% of Aero is aftermarket (growing 5%+)

10% Auto (growing LSD-MSD - Secular shift to using aluminum)

10% Class 8 Truck (in decline - down 10% in NA)
 
10% packaging (stable)

30% industrial applications (flat - LSD.. but cyclical...includes some O&G exposure)

Bull case is that the company has room to improve margins (big margin differential to KALU and PCP) and has underperformed on profitability. Headcount seems much higher than PCP

Bears argue we`re at peak aero cycle and that the industry faces risk of destocking and widebody deferralls, which has incrementally more shipset content than narrowbody. Auto peak and industrial peak as well.

Aero is the main driver for growth....the upside is that production rates hold and that they continue to win marketshare on parts for each new aircraft in production


- Highly levered - 3.5x Net debt
- the company has a 20% stake in AA, which it plans to sell over the next year or so - this will help pay down debt and could improve the multiple

Elliot Letter Highlights:

- Wants to add 5 board seats and former SPR CEO
- Believes EPS segment is not structurally different than PCP and no reason why it can`t achieve the same margins longer term (900 bps difference). Closing gap to peers is worth $10 per share
- GRP margin guidance is conservative - 150 bps of improvement comes from simply eliminating can sheet volumes...closing the gap half way to peers would be worth $4.41 along
- Overhead cost cutting guidance is $50 million...Elliot believes $100 mln is more realistic
- Value of ARNC could be $36-$43 per share (they dont show the math)



","Assumptions:
- 2019 Topline growth 1.5% (half of cons at 3%)
- margins flat
- $2206M EBITDAP
7.5x EPS
5.5x GRP
TCS 5.0x
EV = $14194
- Net Debt: $442
+ Cash proceeds from sale $250M (out of $300M)
Equity = $7749
Shares 497
Price = $15.59

","Blue Sky Scenario: $31.81
- Assumes no sale but a turnaround of the business with margin improvement in the EPS segment that was core to Elliot`s thesis
- Note many analysts said EPS has some structural challenges and do not believe it could get to PCP margins

- EPS (engineered product systems) margins reach PCP margins (28-29% before going private - Elliot thesis) which is an 800bps improvement to ARNC and completed in 3 years (2021)
- 5% topline growth (consensus is between 4-5%)
- Assume consensus estimates for GRP and TCS

- Implies EBITDAP in 2021 of $3,060M

- 9.5x EBITDA for EPS (higher than average due to aero exposure)
- 8x EBITDA for GRP 
- 8x EBITDA for TCS 
- These are bull case multiples that CS used... blends to 8.9x
CSTM (6.5x), ATI (8.3x) and KALU (8.4x) are the core peers... CSTM is a turnaround story so 8.5x seems reasonable

- Implies EV of $27,234M
- Less: Net Debt $6,325M (includes pension of $1.8B)
- Equity value of $20,909M
- Shares O/S = 497
- Implies Price of $42.07/share by end of 2020
- Discounted back 15% equals $31.81/share


WIC Realistic Upside Case: $27
- EPS Margins get halfway to PCP (i.e. 400bps or 24%) by 2021
- 4.5% growth (in line with consensus)
- Assume consensus estimates for GRP and TCS
- Implies EBITDAP in 2021 of $2,740M
- Same multiples
- Implies EV of 34,386M
- Less: Net Debt $6,325M (includes pension of $1.8B)
- Equity value of $18,061M
- Shares O/S = 497
- Implies Price of $36.34/share by end of 2020
- Discounted back 15% equals $27.47/share


Base Case: $21.75-24.00
- Cons topline and margins for 2019
- EBITDAP of $2,224M
- 7.5x - 8.0x EV/EBITDAP multiple
- Implies EV between $16,680M - $17,792M
- Less $5,864M net debt
- Equity Value between $10,816M - $11,928M
- Shares O/S = 497
- Implies price between $21.76 - $24.00


Upside LBO: $27.00
- Assumes EPS margins reach PCC level by year 5 (vs 3 years in the Elliott plan)
- 4.5% growth
- 6.0x Debt/EBITDAP
- 9.0x exit multiple

Base Case LBO: $24.50
- Assumes EPS margins only go 75% to PCP level by year 5 (vs 800bps in 3 years in the Elliot Plan)
- 4.5% growth
- 6.0x Debt/DEBITDAP
- 8.5x exit multiple

Bear Case LBO: $23.00
- Assumes EPS margins only go 50% to PCP level by year 5 (vs 800bps in 3 years in the Elliot Plan)
- 4.5% growth
- 6.0x Debt/DEBITDAP
- 8.5x exit multiple

There are many structural reasons why assume Hunter Harrison can achieve 1000 bps of improvement is optimistic:

1)	Length of haul / geographic terrain
a.	As you can see, CSX and NSC have shorter lengths of haul. This means there are more frequent stops and therefore trains do not get as much velocity and are less efficient

2)	Labor rates
a.	It appears that structurally, CSX has had upward pressure to labor rates since 2012. This could be due labor laws, unions etc. 
b.	Both companies have actually cut the workforce significant (CSX by 15%, CP by 20%).so this cost per employee may very well be structural

3)	Coal and Intermodal exposure
a.	CSX has a worse mix (higher coal and intermodal exposure) than western and Canadian rails

2319,239,2017-02-17,0,kkeung,PAH US EQUITY,Soft,3,2017-02-16,2019-06-30,,,"Bloomberg reported last Friday that the company was weighing a split of agrochemical business (pesticides). Given consolidation in the agrochemical segment (Dow/Dupont, Syngenta/ChemChina, Monsanto/Bayer), there is a view that the entity could be merged with some divestiture assets or could be a focus for any player looking to further bulk up. The remaining business is in electronic chemicals, a segment that has also faced consolidation theories such as the potential sale of Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP). 

Bears:
- High beta
- diversity of Performance segment and combo with Ag creates challenges for investors on valuation
- deserves conglomerate discount given numerous SKUs and end markets
- Peers are divesting assets to create leaner pure-plays. Argument is that simplicity brings enhanced profit, better ROC, and easier forecasting/understanding by investors
- difficult to see synergies in operating distinct businesses
- FX - 80% of revs are outside of NA...no hedging
- high leverage (6.2x TTM) - but CC and UNVR have performed well despite leverage concerns
- Worry that management cannot stay disciplined and will go back to M&A instead of delevering - credibility is an issue (company issued equity to pay debt after saying they wouldn`t)


Bulls:

- Attractive on FCF yield, asset light business model (capex 2% of sales which is on the low end for US chems)
- delevering story - GS forecasts 3.6x net debt by 2019
- Beneficiary from AG up cycle - Crop protection is 51% of earnings...could see inflection in Ag space, corn futures higher, better inventory levels etc
- MON saw good results in Q1, especially in South America where PAH is heavily exposed, said that price for glyphosate is inflecting 
- Bulls believe we are at or near the bottom of the Ag cycle
- estimates are assuming LSD growth but bulls believe revs could grow 4-5% if there`s a return to more robust growth in Ag
- EBITDA declined 12% in 2015 from O&G collapse, LatAm FX headwinds, and Ag market weakness - Bulls argue those headwinds have lapped and PAH is poised to grow from rebounding Ag market and favorable end markets of Performance chems
- Short interest is at 14%, off highs of 16% in Feb...discounting better-than-expected earnings potential.
- Divesting assets could reduce leverage and interest cost (avg cost of debt 7.2%) 
- cons doesn`t give much credit for debt pay downs...street expecting Int expense to be flat in 2018...Bulls think they can lower int by 10% if applying all of 2018 FCF
- 34% of debt is floating rate - risk if LIBOR increases and partially offsets reduction in debt
- Lower than average Iinterest coverage ratio
- Ag business has more exposure to higher growth regions than peers like FMC - so in theory, maybe they get a premium multiple - Off patent also grows faster (5% CAGR vs 1% LT)
- Ag business has 2/3 sales from non-row crops like fruits, vegetables, nuts, vines which are less volatile vs multinationals (MON, DD, BASF)

Soon thereafter the honeymoon ended as investments in Ag and offshore chemicals were poorly timed and with hindsight look expensive given they were executed at top-of-cycle. An earnings downturn in 2014/15 magnified PAHs net debt leverage while equity offerings, used in part to fund its investments, diluted share holders (88.5mn at IPO vs 299mn shares currently). Especially disruptive was the Series B preferred equity offering associated with PAHs February 2015 acquisition of Arysta that created a sharp downward price move from makewholes on warrants, which accelerated PAHs share price decline in a challenging 2015 business environment. The final blow to investor confidence came when its CEO unexpectedly left the company in late 2015. The share price reached all-time lows and short interest rose to all-time highs (15% of float) in the following weeks.

However, over the past three months PAH has been the bestperforming chemicals name under coverage (+60%), driven by the resolution of its Series B preferred stock obligations, the re-pricing of $2bn in term loans that saves $11mn of annual interest rate expense and delays repayment obligations by three years, and a solid 3Q16 print leading to raised FY16 EBITDA guidance.

- DR is suggesting buyers for the AG business will be private equity. Can you run an LBO on that business to understand what price PE can pay for that business? 
- Whatever price the LBO gets, assume the after-tax proceeds are used to paydown debt (not sure if there will be much tax leakage but find out if possible)
- After the paydown of debt, compare to peers and if the remainco is underlevered, I would at baseline assume they will buyback stock to get some accretion... although if you are valuing in EV/EBITDA you won`t see the uplift so maybe the remainco just trades at a premium multiple?
- Separately... does any of the FMC situation change the outcome on what you think the AG business can be sold for? Perhaps worth calling FMC to understand how competitive that process was

What happened in 2015?

Soon thereafter the honeymoon ended as investments in Ag and offshore chemicals were poorly timed and with hindsight look expensive given they were executed at top-of-cycle. An earnings downturn in 2014/15 magnified PAHs net debt leverage while equity offerings, used in part to fund its investments, diluted share holders (88.5mn at IPO vs 299mn shares currently). Especially disruptive was the Series B preferred equity offering associated with PAHs February 2015 acquisition of Arysta that created a sharp downward price move from makewholes on warrants, which accelerated PAHs share price decline in a challenging 2015 business environment. The final blow to investor confidence came when its CEO unexpectedly left the company in late 2015. The share price reached all-time lows and short interest rose to all-time highs (15% of float) in the following weeks.

However, over the past three months PAH has been the bestperforming chemicals name under coverage (+60%), driven by the resolution of its Series B preferred stock obligations, the re-pricing of $2bn in term loans that saves $11mn of annual interest rate expense and delays repayment obligations by three years, and a solid 3Q16 print leading to raised FY16 EBITDA guidance.

- DR is suggesting buyers for the AG business will be private equity. Can you run an LBO on that business to understand what price PE can pay for that business? 
- Whatever price the LBO gets, assume the after-tax proceeds are used to paydown debt (not sure if there will be much tax leakage but find out if possible)
- After the paydown of debt, compare to peers and if the remainco is underlevered, I would at baseline assume they will buyback stock to get some accretion... although if you are valuing in EV/EBITDA you won`t see the uplift so maybe the remainco just trades at a premium multiple?

What happened in 2015?

Soon thereafter the honeymoon ended as investments in Ag and offshore chemicals were poorly timed and with hindsight look expensive given they were executed at top-of-cycle. An earnings downturn in 2014/15 magnified PAHs net debt leverage while equity offerings, used in part to fund its investments, diluted share holders (88.5mn at IPO vs 299mn shares currently). Especially disruptive was the Series B preferred equity offering associated with PAHs February 2015 acquisition of Arysta that created a sharp downward price move from makewholes on warrants, which accelerated PAHs share price decline in a challenging 2015 business environment. The final blow to investor confidence came when its CEO unexpectedly left the company in late 2015. The share price reached all-time lows and short interest rose to all-time highs (15% of float) in the following weeks.

However, over the past three months PAH has been the bestperforming chemicals name under coverage (+60%), driven by the resolution of its Series B preferred stock obligations, the re-pricing of $2bn in term loans that saves $11mn of annual interest rate expense and delays repayment obligations by three years, and a solid 3Q16 print leading to raised FY16 EBITDA guidance.

- After the paydown of debt, compare to peers and if the remainco is underlevered, I would at baseline assume they will buyback stock to get some accretion... although if you are valuing in EV/EBITDA you won`t see the uplift so maybe the remainco just trades at a premium multiple?

- 34% of debt is floating rate - risk if LIBOR increases and partially offsets reduction in debt
- Lower than average Iinterest coverage ratio
- Ag business has more exposure to higher growth regions than peers like FMC - so in theory, maybe they get a premium multiple - Off patent also grows faster (5% CAGR vs 1% LT)
- Ag business has 2/3 sales from non-row crops like fruits, vegetables, nuts, vines which are less volatile vs multinationals (MON, DD, BASF)


What happened in 2015?

Soon thereafter the honeymoon ended as investments in Ag and offshore chemicals were poorly timed and with hindsight look expensive given they were executed at top-of-cycle. An earnings downturn in 2014/15 magnified PAHs net debt leverage while equity offerings, used in part to fund its investments, diluted share holders (88.5mn at IPO vs 299mn shares currently). Especially disruptive was the Series B preferred equity offering associated with PAHs February 2015 acquisition of Arysta that created a sharp downward price move from makewholes on warrants, which accelerated PAHs share price decline in a challenging 2015 business environment. The final blow to investor confidence came when its CEO unexpectedly left the company in late 2015. The share price reached all-time lows and short interest rose to all-time highs (15% of float) in the following weeks.

However, over the past three months PAH has been the bestperforming chemicals name under coverage (+60%), driven by the resolution of its Series B preferred stock obligations, the re-pricing of $2bn in term loans that saves $11mn of annual interest rate expense and delays repayment obligations by three years, and a solid 3Q16 print leading to raised FY16 EBITDA guidance.


[TED - 4/7/2017]
- DR is suggesting buyers for the AG business will be private equity. Can you run an LBO on that business to understand what price PE can pay for that business? 
- Whatever price the LBO gets, assume the after-tax proceeds are used to paydown debt (not sure if there will be much tax leakage but find out if possible)
- After the paydown of debt, compare to peers and if the remainco is underlevered, I would at baseline assume they will buyback stock to get some accretion... although if you are valuing in EV/EBITDA you won`t see the uplift so maybe the remainco just trades at a premium multiple?
- Separately... does any of the FMC situation change the outcome on what you think the AG business can be sold for? Perhaps worth calling FMC to understand how competitive that process was

- 25.8% Margins by 2020 (inline with KMG Chem - which was the lowest among ENTG, CCMP, and VSM)
- Most analysts project 50-70 bps margin expansion per year which would get 2020 margins to 24.5%
- 4% revenue growth - inline with industry growth
- 8.8x EBITDA - inline with low end of comp group 
- discounted back 10%
- Assumes debt pay down of ~$220 mln per year from FCF (guidance)

SWFT SHs to receive 0.72x KNX shares. SWFT SHs to own 54% of proforma business

Bulls
- KNX trades at a higher multiple because of best in class management team and operating margins
- Premium multiple
- In the past they have made acquisitions of underpeforming carriers and turned those businesses around
- We are seeing demand improving off trough rates and over capacity, which lends itself to high incremental businesses 
- Leverage at SWFT was a big reason for its discount multiple on PE
- high growth logistics business is growing top line and margin

Bears
- Difficult to get synergies in fragmented trucking industry where there is little regional overlap
- unsure where revenue synergies are coming from

Industry concerns/drivers
- Direct play on US GDP
- highly commoditized space with thousands of individual trucking companies competing
- litte room for economies of scale
- highly capital intensive but TLs generate decent FCF and capex is variable
- ELD`s - potential to disrupt mom and pops and reduce capacity
- Pricing - spot pricing is challengin and contract years are flatish but this is influenced by capacity and growing demand 
- Pricing is subject to supply/demand of available trucks, and comparable freight rates
- Driver availability - there is high turnover and increasing costs because of driver shortages

KNX Overview
Knight decentralizes its operations by managing each service center like an individual small trucking company, thereby avoiding the diseconomies of scale that larger carriers encounter. This approach provides better cost controls, lowers driver turnover, and provides better customer service. The cost controls produce superior margins. Service levels at average to above-average rates produce superior growth. KNX has consistently maintained a low-80s asset-based operating ratio (i.e., 10-20% operating margin).

Questions:
- where are rev synergies coming from?
    - Cost synergies sound achievable and from a reduction in corp/back office
    - revenues synergies from improving yield through better contract pricing, revenue per truck, logistics growth

- Why are SWFT margins lower?
    - KNX operates a decentralized operation and has been more disciplined in its freight management, something SWFT can adopt longer term
    - Some of it is mix - SWFT has more intermodal, reefer, dedicated etc

- What has allowed KNX to outperform its peers?

- What will management look like post merger?
    - Jerry at SWFT was known to be a wild card. However his voting power in this transaction is greatly reduced, so that could remove some overhang

UBS  $35 PT (unchanged)
Methodology:  PE multiple to standalone KNX
-          Synergies are reasonable
-          Half of synergies are rev based  assuming tighter TL market and stronger pricing
-          ELD implementation will improve excess capacity

Bulls
- KNX trades at a higher multiple because of best in class management team and operating margins
- Premium multiple
- In the past they have made acquisitions of underpeforming carriers and turned those businesses around
- We are seeing demand improving off trough rates and over capacity, which lends itself to high incremental businesses 
- Leverage at SWFT was a big reason for its discount multiple on PE
- high growth logistics business is growing top line and margin

Bears
- Difficult to get synergies in fragmented trucking industry where there is little regional overlap
- unsure where revenue synergies are coming from

Industry concerns/drivers
- Direct play on US GDP
- highly commoditized space with thousands of individual trucking companies competing
- litte room for economies of scale
- highly capital intensive but TLs generate decent FCF and capex is variable
- ELD`s - potential to disrupt mom and pops and reduce capacity
- Pricing - spot pricing is challengin and contract years are flatish but this is influenced by capacity and growing demand 
- Pricing is subject to supply/demand of available trucks, and comparable freight rates
- Driver availability - there is high turnover and increasing costs because of driver shortages

KNX Overview
Knight decentralizes its operations by managing each service center like an individual small trucking company, thereby avoiding the diseconomies of scale that larger carriers encounter. This approach provides better cost controls, lowers driver turnover, and provides better customer service. The cost controls produce superior margins. Service levels at average to above-average rates produce superior growth. KNX has consistently maintained a low-80s asset-based operating ratio (i.e., 10-20% operating margin).

Questions:
- where are rev synergies coming from?
    - Cost synergies sound achievable and from a reduction in corp/back office
    - revenues synergies from improving yield through better contract pricing, revenue per truck, logistics growth

- Why are SWFT margins lower?
    - KNX operates a decentralized operation and has been more disciplined in its freight management, something SWFT can adopt longer term
    - Some of it is mix - SWFT has more intermodal, reefer, dedicated etc

- What has allowed KNX to outperform its peers?

- What will management look like post merger?
    - Jerry at SWFT was known to be a wild card. However his voting power in this transaction is greatly reduced, so that could remove some overhang

-          Waiting for better entry point. If there is a pullback in shares or inflection in fundamentals, we would not hesitate to revisit our thesis
-          Lowered KNX EPS to $1.02 from $1.17

- KNX trades at a higher multiple because of best in class management team and operating margins
- Premium multiple
- In the past they have made acquisitions of underpeforming carriers and turned those businesses around
- We are seeing demand improving off trough rates and over capacity, which lends itself to high incremental businesses 
- Leverage at SWFT was a big reason for its discount multiple on PE
- high growth logistics business is growing top line and margin

Bears
- Difficult to get synergies in fragmented trucking industry where there is little regional overlap
- unsure where revenue synergies are coming from

Industry concerns/drivers
- Direct play on US GDP
- highly commoditized space with thousands of individual trucking companies competing
- litte room for economies of scale
- highly capital intensive but TLs generate decent FCF and capex is variable
- ELD`s - potential to disrupt mom and pops and reduce capacity
- Pricing - spot pricing is challengin and contract years are flatish but this is influenced by capacity and growing demand 
- Pricing is subject to supply/demand of available trucks, and comparable freight rates
- Driver availability - there is high turnover and increasing costs because of driver shortages

KNX Overview
Knight decentralizes its operations by managing each service center like an individual small trucking company, thereby avoiding the diseconomies of scale that larger carriers encounter. This approach provides better cost controls, lowers driver turnover, and provides better customer service. The cost controls produce superior margins. Service levels at average to above-average rates produce superior growth. KNX has consistently maintained a low-80s asset-based operating ratio (i.e., 10-20% operating margin).

Questions:
- where are rev synergies coming from?
    - Cost synergies sound achievable and from a reduction in corp/back office
    - revenues synergies from improving yield through better contract pricing, revenue per truck, logistics growth

- Why are SWFT margins lower?
    - KNX operates a decentralized operation and has been more disciplined in its freight management, something SWFT can adopt longer term
    - Some of it is mix - SWFT has more intermodal, reefer, dedicated etc

- What has allowed KNX to outperform its peers?

- What will management look like post merger?
    - Jerry at SWFT was known to be a wild card. However his voting power in this transaction is greatly reduced, so that could remove some overhang

SWFT SHs to receive 0.72x KNX shares. SWFT SHs to own 54% of proforma business

Bulls
- KNX trades at a higher multiple because of best in class management team and operating margins
- Premium multiple
- In the past they have made acquisitions of underpeforming carriers and turned those businesses around
- We are seeing demand improving off trough rates and over capacity, which lends itself to high incremental businesses 
- Leverage at SWFT was a big reason for its discount multiple on PE
- high growth logistics business is growing top line and margin

Bears
- Difficult to get synergies in fragmented trucking industry where there is little regional overlap
- unsure where revenue synergies are coming from

Industry concerns/drivers
- Direct play on US GDP
- highly commoditized space with thousands of individual trucking companies competing
- litte room for economies of scale
- highly capital intensive but TLs generate decent FCF and capex is variable
- ELD`s - potential to disrupt mom and pops and reduce capacity
- Pricing - spot pricing is challengin and contract years are flatish but this is influenced by capacity and growing demand 
- Pricing is subject to supply/demand of available trucks, and comparable freight rates
- Driver availability - there is high turnover and increasing costs because of driver shortages

KNX Overview
Knight decentralizes its operations by managing each service center like an individual small trucking company, thereby avoiding the diseconomies of scale that larger carriers encounter. This approach provides better cost controls, lowers driver turnover, and provides better customer service. The cost controls produce superior margins. Service levels at average to above-average rates produce superior growth. KNX has consistently maintained a low-80s asset-based operating ratio (i.e., 10-20% operating margin).

Questions:
- where are rev synergies coming from?
    - Cost synergies sound achievable and from a reduction in corp/back office
    - revenues synergies from improving yield through better contract pricing, revenue per truck, logistics growth

- Why are SWFT margins lower?
    - KNX operates a decentralized operation and has been more disciplined in its freight management, something SWFT can adopt longer term
    - Some of it is mix - SWFT has more intermodal, reefer, dedicated etc

- What has allowed KNX to outperform its peers?

- What will management look like post merger?
    - Jerry at SWFT was known to be a wild card. However his voting power in this transaction is greatly reduced, so that could remove some overhang

-          Waiting for better entry point. If there is a pullback in shares or inflection in fundamentals, we would not hesitate to revisit our thesis
-          Lowered KNX EPS to $1.02 from $1.17

On July 10, FTC sued TROX to prevent its acquisition

On July 17, TROX announced an agreement with Venator for the remedy of the European paper laminates business (our estimate is 10kt of 8120 Grade) and separately an agreement for the two companies to engage in exclusive negotiations for the purchase by Venator of the 240kt Ashtabula, OH facility currently held by Cristal for $1.1bn if the divestment of Ashtabula is required by Tronox to obtain regulatory approval for its pending merger with Cristal. This amount will be cut to $900m if TROX awaits the decision of the FTCs Administrative Law Judge following an adverse ruling by the US District Court. Finally, Venator also announced that they are reviewing the full rebuild of their previously damaged Pori facility, in light of the transaction.

Sept 9 - From Nick at Rockcreek: The DC District Courts September 5 ruling against the parties, granting the FTC a preliminary injunction, suggests the FTC ALJ will also rule against the parties when he is due to make a decision in December or January.  Absent a settlement with the FTC in the intervening months, it is hard to see how the companies will close the merger.

On July 10, FTC sued TROX to prevent its acquisition

On July 17, TROX announced an agreement with Venator for the remedy of the European paper laminates business (our estimate is 10kt of 8120 Grade) and separately an agreement for the two companies to engage in exclusive negotiations for the purchase by Venator of the 240kt Ashtabula, OH facility currently held by Cristal for $1.1bn if the divestment of Ashtabula is required by Tronox to obtain regulatory approval for its pending merger with Cristal. This amount will be cut to $900m if TROX awaits the decision of the FTCs Administrative Law Judge following an adverse ruling by the US District Court. Finally, Venator also announced that they are reviewing the full rebuild of their previously damaged Pori facility, in light of the transaction.

Sept 9 - From Nick at Rockcreek: The DC District Courts September 5 ruling against the parties, granting the FTC a preliminary injunction, suggests the FTC ALJ will also rule against the parties when he is due to make a decision in December or January.  Absent a settlement with the FTC in the intervening months, it is hard to see how the companies will close the merger.

My 2019 revenue is 688.6mm vs. street at 713mm and my EBITDA is 209mm vs. the street at 247mm

Mgmt has guided to a near term margin of 34-37%, which on my revenue would imply 234mm at the low end.

So, my EBITDA is pretty bearish on continued expense growth with revenue slow down.

Post spin to CQ3 2018 earnings miss and lower guidance, CARS has traded 9x to 11x NTM EBITDA and 7.25% to 9.5% FCFE yield.

9x my NTM EBITDA is $17.82 vs. 9x consensus = $21.50
9.5% my NTM FCF is $18.40 vs. 9.5% consensus = $22.50

So i take a blend, being cognizant of the 20+ short interest and think $20 is fair.

FWIW: 4x my 2018 recurring revenue is $22/share, on my 2020 revenue which should be normalized = $23.20









OLD VALUATION
225m of 2017 EBITDA at 9x - EBITDA is cash EBITDA assuming no affiliate conversion and removes 25mm of amortization associated with affiliates.  9x EBITDA is consensus bear case multiple.

I use 6.5x leverage on 2020 EBITDA as this is normalized EBITDA and gets to a healthy split of 70/30 debt equity.  Using a 10.5x exit multiple gets a 15.5% IRR at $29


Interestingly at these leverage levels, they would breach the interest expense deductibility thresholds and given they are asset light, there`s not a significant tax savings as a private asset.

DOV hires William Blair to hive off aftermarket automotive unit

Background:

8/3/17 - WSJ reported that DOV is exploring strategic options for most of its energy business through a sale, spin, or merger of the business. The article reported that a sale could fetch $3-4 billion

9/12/17  DOV announced that it completed a strategic review of the portfolio and is focused on strategic alternatives for DOV upstream energy business Wellsite

Strategic Alternatives:

-	Evaluating Strategic Alternatives for Wellsite
o	Includes Artificial Lift, Energy Automation and US Synthetic businesses

-	Range of alternatives includes Spin, Sale, or other Strategic Combo
o	Logical suitors would be HAL, Baker Hughes, SLB, NOV

-	Decision to be made by year end 2018

Well Site Business (about 70% of current Energy business):
 
Remain-Co DOV (implies that the remaining energy business will go into Engineered Systems)


Comps

DOV has Four main segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food

The hedge is using a number of peers weighted by exposure to each segment

Valuation

Bull Arguments:

What can get the stock higher?
-	Re-Rating of some kind on the remain-co where they announce some new multi-year margin expansion story  Similar to ITW 
o	Focus on margin expansion and cash flow
o	The problem with DOV is that theyve spent too much time on capital allocation  they continuously buy and sell businesses
-	Bulls believe the remain-co could have a re-rate to a higher multi-industrial multiple overtime  13x (CS)

-	Each segment is not bottom of the barrel, but if you look at where peer margins are, each segment has upside potential of a few hundred BPS in margin  this is highlighted by their 3 year plan

-	If the CEO retires  he is not liked and analysts say that the stock gets a slight discount because of the CEO

-	Tax implications of a sale of Wellsite is unclear  Baird analyst has asked the company a number of times and they said they would not comment

-	Sale of the Wellsite business and if the company uses that cash to do strategic M&A

o	Baird thinks DOV would look at buying something like WBT (formerly Manitowoc Food)
	Baird spoke to the head of corp development:
	Wants to acquire low cyclicality business to enhance the DOV multiple. Specifically brought up food equipment

Bear Arguments:

-	Each segment could have its own challenges:
o	Refrigeration
	Low barriers to entry, Panasonic recently entered the space and are selling at much lower costs
	Competition would bring margin pressure. Business isnt growing much either
o	Fluids:
	Retail fueling business is not growing
	Once the EMV upgrade cycle is over, there will be a growth cliff to deal with
o	Engineered Systems:
	A lot of growth driven by auto dealer expansion  Bears point to Auto SAAR and China dealership growth slowing
o	Energy
	2018 will be a tough year and potentially wont see the growth that people are expecting

-	CEO not well liked  company has been viewed as inefficient with capital allocation (major strategic moves into and then out of markets like wireless acoustic, upstream energy). Investors are wary of how proceeds would be used
o	PNR has not re-reated since the electrical spin


Scenarios:

Upside SOTP: $94  Assumes DOV hits upside of 3 year targets annually

Background:

8/3/17 - WSJ reported that DOV is exploring strategic options for most of its energy business through a sale, spin, or merger of the business. The article reported that a sale could fetch $3-4 billion

9/12/17  DOV announced that it completed a strategic review of the portfolio and is focused on strategic alternatives for DOV upstream energy business Wellsite

Strategic Alternatives:

-	Evaluating Strategic Alternatives for Wellsite
o	Includes Artificial Lift, Energy Automation and US Synthetic businesses

-	Range of alternatives includes Spin, Sale, or other Strategic Combo
o	Logical suitors would be HAL, Baker Hughes, SLB, NOV

-	Decision to be made by year end 2018

DOV has Four main segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food

Valuation

Bull Arguments:

What can get the stock higher?
-	Re-Rating of some kind on the remain-co where they announce some new multi-year margin expansion story  Similar to ITW 
o	Focus on margin expansion and cash flow
o	The problem with DOV is that theyve spent too much time on capital allocation  they continuously buy and sell businesses
-	Bulls believe the remain-co could have a re-rate to a higher multi-industrial multiple overtime  13x (CS)

-	Each segment is not bottom of the barrel, but if you look at where peer margins are, each segment has upside potential of a few hundred BPS in margin  this is highlighted by their 3 year plan

-	If the CEO retires  he is not liked and analysts say that the stock gets a slight discount because of the CEO

-	Tax implications of a sale of Wellsite is unclear  Baird analyst has asked the company a number of times and they said they would not comment

-	Sale of the Wellsite business and if the company uses that cash to do strategic M&A

o	Baird thinks DOV would look at buying something like WBT (formerly Manitowoc Food)

-	Tax implications of a sale of Wellsite is unclear  Baird analyst has asked the company a number of times and they said they would not comment

-	Sale of the Wellsite business and if the company uses that cash to do strategic M&A

o	Baird thinks DOV would look at buying something like WBT (formerly Manitowoc Food)
	Baird spoke to the head of corp development:
	Wants to acquire low cyclicality business to enhance the DOV multiple. Specifically brought up food equipment

Bear Arguments:

-	Each segment could have its own challenges:
o	Refrigeration
	Low barriers to entry, Panasonic recently entered the space and are selling at much lower costs
	Competition would bring margin pressure. Business isnt growing much either
o	Fluids:
	Retail fueling business is not growing
	Once the EMV upgrade cycle is over, there will be a growth cliff to deal with
o	Engineered Systems:
	A lot of growth driven by auto dealer expansion  Bears point to Auto SAAR and China dealership growth slowing
o	Energy
	2018 will be a tough year and potentially wont see the growth that people are expecting

-	CEO not well liked  company has been viewed as inefficient with capital allocation (major strategic moves into and then out of markets like wireless acoustic, upstream energy). Investors are wary of how proceeds would be used
o	PNR has not re-reated since the electrical spin


Scenarios:

Upside SOTP: $94  Assumes DOV hits upside of 3 year targets annually

If Wellsite is sold for $4 billion (Original WSJ said $3-4 billion) and if they can somehow offset the tax leakage, the upside SOTP would be $98


Downside: $78

ALV announced that management is undergoing a review of the business with the intent to separate the Passive Safety and the Electronics business. It also hosted an investor day today and gave LT targets

https://www.autoliv.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PressReleases.aspx?releaseid=1365131

Electronics:
-	Comprises of Active Safety (auto radars, cameras, driver assist, night vision, positioning)
-	Restraint control and Sensing
-	Brake systems

Market is growing from $20 billion in 2017 to $40 billion in 2025
-	Electronics revenue were 2.2 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $3 billion in 2020
-	Used to partner with MBLY but moved its software division in house and therefore has lost some share to the likes of Conti, Bosch, and DLPH

Passive Safety
-	Airbag systems
-	Steering wheels
-	Seatbelts

Airbag market share of 39% in 2016 but over the last few years has been winning 50% share due to Takata failures
-	After 2020, expects to grow with SAAR + 1%
-	Some growing content in airbags (content on vehicles in places like India continues to grow)


Topline guidance given today was higher than consensus:

-	Revenue topline for both companies was decently above consensus targets
o	Passive safety growth implies greater win share because of Takata but also that ALV is getting better pricing because its become the only game in town. 
	Annual price downs for airbags is usually steeper than other products because its more commoditized
-	Margin at passive safety better than expected
o	Again possible due to pricing
o	More efficiency at production facilities
o	Higher capacity utilization due to share gains
-	Active Safety margin lower than cons:
o	Higher spending on R&D because they are building their own in house software (discontinued partnership with MBLY) and JV with Volvo thats negative cash flow currently 
 

One year stock chart
                         
 

Comps

As you can see, ALV has always traded on a premium EBITDA and PE multiple despite having most of its earnings from passive safety. Some people think the stock gets a premium because its a European name and Swedish investors treat this more like an industrial stock

 

 


SH List

 


Valuation

Bull Arguments: $150
-	Great management  company has been one of the best suppliers over the years, well respected by OEMs for quality
-	Passive safety business taking market share
-	Oligopoly between a few players, so it deserves a higher multiple than low growth peers that compete against more players
-	Higher margins than a lot of the low growth peers (ex  Seating peers are mid-high single digit margin while ALV targets 13% EBIT margin), generates good cash flow
-	Electronics business could get 15x+ EBITDA multiple
-	Electronics business could be sold
-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

Bull SOTP gets north of $140
Barclays analyst thinks Bulls are at $160

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

Using Bairds low end range of SOTP with 6.0x on passive and 1.0x sales on Active (BMO used 1.0-1.5x sales previously)

Barclays thinks downside range is $90

https://www.autoliv.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PressReleases.aspx?releaseid=1365131

Electronics:
-	Comprises of Active Safety (auto radars, cameras, driver assist, night vision, positioning)
-	Restraint control and Sensing
-	Brake systems

Market is growing from $20 billion in 2017 to $40 billion in 2025
-	Electronics revenue were 2.2 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $3 billion in 2020
-	Used to partner with MBLY but moved its software division in house and therefore has lost some share to the likes of Conti, Bosch, and DLPH

Passive Safety
-	Airbag systems
-	Steering wheels
-	Seatbelts

Airbag market share of 39% in 2016 but over the last few years has been winning 50% share due to Takata failures
-	After 2020, expects to grow with SAAR + 1%
-	Some growing content in airbags (content on vehicles in places like India continues to grow)


Topline guidance given today was higher than consensus:

-	Revenue topline for both companies was decently above consensus targets
o	Passive safety growth implies greater win share because of Takata but also that ALV is getting better pricing because its become the only game in town. 
	Annual price downs for airbags is usually steeper than other products because its more commoditized
-	Margin at passive safety better than expected
o	Again possible due to pricing
o	More efficiency at production facilities
o	Higher capacity utilization due to share gains
-	Active Safety margin lower than cons:
o	Higher spending on R&D because they are building their own in house software (discontinued partnership with MBLY) and JV with Volvo thats negative cash flow currently 
 

One year stock chart
                         
 

Comps

As you can see, ALV has always traded on a premium EBITDA and PE multiple despite having most of its earnings from passive safety. Some people think the stock gets a premium because its a European name and Swedish investors treat this more like an industrial stock

Valuation

Bull Arguments: $150
-	Great management  company has been one of the best suppliers over the years, well respected by OEMs for quality
-	Passive safety business taking market share
-	Oligopoly between a few players, so it deserves a higher multiple than low growth peers that compete against more players
-	Higher margins than a lot of the low growth peers (ex  Seating peers are mid-high single digit margin while ALV targets 13% EBIT margin), generates good cash flow
-	Electronics business could get 15x+ EBITDA multiple
-	Electronics business could be sold
-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

Bull SOTP gets north of $140
Barclays analyst thinks Bulls are at $160

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

Using Bairds low end range of SOTP with 6.0x on passive and 1.0x sales on Active (BMO used 1.0-1.5x sales previously)

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

https://www.autoliv.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PressReleases.aspx?releaseid=1365131

Electronics:
-	Comprises of Active Safety (auto radars, cameras, driver assist, night vision, positioning)
-	Restraint control and Sensing
-	Brake systems

Market is growing from $20 billion in 2017 to $40 billion in 2025
-	Electronics revenue were 2.2 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $3 billion in 2020
-	Used to partner with MBLY but moved its software division in house and therefore has lost some share to the likes of Conti, Bosch, and DLPH

Passive Safety
-	Airbag systems
-	Steering wheels
-	Seatbelts

Airbag market share of 39% in 2016 but over the last few years has been winning 50% share due to Takata failures
-	After 2020, expects to grow with SAAR + 1%
-	Some growing content in airbags (content on vehicles in places like India continues to grow)


Topline guidance given today was higher than consensus:

-	Revenue topline for both companies was decently above consensus targets
o	Passive safety growth implies greater win share because of Takata but also that ALV is getting better pricing because its become the only game in town. 
	Annual price downs for airbags is usually steeper than other products because its more commoditized
-	Margin at passive safety better than expected
o	Again possible due to pricing
o	More efficiency at production facilities
o	Higher capacity utilization due to share gains
-	Active Safety margin lower than cons:
o	Higher spending on R&D because they are building their own in house software (discontinued partnership with MBLY) and JV with Volvo thats negative cash flow currently 
 

One year stock chart
                         
 

Comps

As you can see, ALV has always traded on a premium EBITDA and PE multiple despite having most of its earnings from passive safety. Some people think the stock gets a premium because its a European name and Swedish investors treat this more like an industrial stock

Valuation

Bull Arguments: $150
-	Great management  company has been one of the best suppliers over the years, well respected by OEMs for quality
-	Passive safety business taking market share
-	Oligopoly between a few players, so it deserves a higher multiple than low growth peers that compete against more players
-	Higher margins than a lot of the low growth peers (ex  Seating peers are mid-high single digit margin while ALV targets 13% EBIT margin), generates good cash flow
-	Electronics business could get 15x+ EBITDA multiple
-	Electronics business could be sold
-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

-	Airbag systems
-	Steering wheels
-	Seatbelts

Airbag market share of 39% in 2016 but over the last few years has been winning 50% share due to Takata failures
-	After 2020, expects to grow with SAAR + 1%
-	Some growing content in airbags (content on vehicles in places like India continues to grow)


Topline guidance given today was higher than consensus:

-	Revenue topline for both companies was decently above consensus targets
o	Passive safety growth implies greater win share because of Takata but also that ALV is getting better pricing because its become the only game in town. 
	Annual price downs for airbags is usually steeper than other products because its more commoditized
-	Margin at passive safety better than expected
o	Again possible due to pricing
o	More efficiency at production facilities
o	Higher capacity utilization due to share gains
-	Active Safety margin lower than cons:
o	Higher spending on R&D because they are building their own in house software (discontinued partnership with MBLY) and JV with Volvo thats negative cash flow currently 
 

One year stock chart
                         
 

Comps

As you can see, ALV has always traded on a premium EBITDA and PE multiple despite having most of its earnings from passive safety. Some people think the stock gets a premium because its a European name and Swedish investors treat this more like an industrial stock

Valuation

Bull Arguments: $150
-	Great management  company has been one of the best suppliers over the years, well respected by OEMs for quality
-	Passive safety business taking market share
-	Oligopoly between a few players, so it deserves a higher multiple than low growth peers that compete against more players
-	Higher margins than a lot of the low growth peers (ex  Seating peers are mid-high single digit margin while ALV targets 13% EBIT margin), generates good cash flow
-	Electronics business could get 15x+ EBITDA multiple
-	Electronics business could be sold
-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

Bull SOTP gets north of $140
Barclays analyst thinks Bulls are at $160

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

https://www.autoliv.com/NewsRoom/Pages/PressReleases.aspx?releaseid=1365131

Electronics:
-	Comprises of Active Safety (auto radars, cameras, driver assist, night vision, positioning)
-	Restraint control and Sensing
-	Brake systems

Market is growing from $20 billion in 2017 to $40 billion in 2025
-	Electronics revenue were 2.2 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $3 billion in 2020
-	Used to partner with MBLY but moved its software division in house and therefore has lost some share to the likes of Conti, Bosch, and DLPH

Passive Safety
-	Airbag systems
-	Steering wheels
-	Seatbelts

Airbag market share of 39% in 2016 but over the last few years has been winning 50% share due to Takata failures
-	After 2020, expects to grow with SAAR + 1%
-	Some growing content in airbags (content on vehicles in places like India continues to grow)


Topline guidance given today was higher than consensus:

-	Revenue topline for both companies was decently above consensus targets
o	Passive safety growth implies greater win share because of Takata but also that ALV is getting better pricing because its become the only game in town. 
	Annual price downs for airbags is usually steeper than other products because its more commoditized
-	Margin at passive safety better than expected
o	Again possible due to pricing
o	More efficiency at production facilities
o	Higher capacity utilization due to share gains
-	Active Safety margin lower than cons:
o	Higher spending on R&D because they are building their own in house software (discontinued partnership with MBLY) and JV with Volvo thats negative cash flow currently 
 

One year stock chart
                         
 

Comps

As you can see, ALV has always traded on a premium EBITDA and PE multiple despite having most of its earnings from passive safety. Some people think the stock gets a premium because its a European name and Swedish investors treat this more like an industrial stock

Valuation

Bull Arguments: $150
-	Great management  company has been one of the best suppliers over the years, well respected by OEMs for quality
-	Passive safety business taking market share
-	Oligopoly between a few players, so it deserves a higher multiple than low growth peers that compete against more players
-	Higher margins than a lot of the low growth peers (ex  Seating peers are mid-high single digit margin while ALV targets 13% EBIT margin), generates good cash flow
-	Electronics business could get 15x+ EBITDA multiple
-	Electronics business could be sold
-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

Bull SOTP gets north of $140
Barclays analyst thinks Bulls are at $160

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

Using Bairds low end range of SOTP with 6.0x on passive and 1.0x sales on Active (BMO used 1.0-1.5x sales previously)

Barclays thinks downside range is $90

-	RemainCo Passive Safety business  Maybe a strategic combination with someone like LEA (ADNT and DLPH recently announced a partnership to build the seat of the future)
-	Because Electronics is developing its inhouse software, eventually those margins will pay off (MBLY had 50% plus margins)

Bull SOTP gets north of $140
Barclays analyst thinks Bulls are at $160

Below MS uses 15x on the electronics businessIt really comes down to the multiple you put there
 

Baird uses 7.0x on the Passive and 2.0x sales on the electronics business
-	2.0x sales is apparently where recent purchase multiples have been. 

 


Bear Arguments: $100

-	Electronics cant survive without on its own  Needs cash flow to fund R&D because its break even right now
o	Very competitive environment  Valeo, Conti, Delphi, silicon valley start ups
o	Growing 35% by 2020 vs competition growing 50%
-	Lost out on some business when it decided to discontinue partnership with MBLY, and therefore growth ramp is taking time
o	So what if orders dont materialize? Theres less certainty around the growth of this business
o	For some perspective  in 2015 ALV guided to 8-9% margin by 2019, now calling for 0-5% EBIT margin by 2020

-	ALV already trades really expensive to peers and offers moderate growth and margin expansion 

-	Passive business, is low growth  deserves lower supplier multiple, not 6.5-7x like bulls think

-	Eventually OEMs will want to source with another supplierOEMs dont like putting all their eggs in one basket

-	Theres always tail risk of an airbag exploding like it did with Takata

-	Electronics is a bubble right now  Eventually when SAAR rolls over, the high valuations will fade

-	Only about 1/3 of the Electronics business (Active Safety) is truly high growth, the other two businesses growing slightly higher than SAARso premium multiple shouldnt be applied to the whole thing  similar to DLPH
-	Bears believe the strong reaction is partially due to short covering as ALV was a highly shorted name (8%)

Using Bairds low end range of SOTP with 6.0x on passive and 1.0x sales on Active (BMO used 1.0-1.5x sales previously)

Barclays thinks downside range is $90

Bloomberg reported synergies could be 600M+ which implies AKZA NA could re-rate higher to 55-60/share (not inclusive of the 29/share cash), which could also be buffeted by speculation that this could spur PPG to return.

If AKZA NA re-rates to 55, would imply $40 for AXTA (vs current price of $29) and assuming a 75% deal probability, would imply AXTA trades at $37.25/share

	Expands footprint materially on the West Coast with Class A assets
	MAC development pipeline provides additional value creation opportunities

Upside: $70 based on NAV

Prior to today, MAC traded at about a 16.5% discount to its NAV of $70 per share, which is the theoretical takeout price in a sale and would imply a cap rate of 4.85%

-	SPG is currently levered about 5.8x net. Assuming they could lever to 6.5x and pay $70 in cash and stock (50/50 split), the deal would be 5% accretive to FFO, assuming $25 mln of synergies (MAC SG&A)

Situation Overview

7/29/16 - ValueAct reports 13D stake in TRN
9/29/17 - Appelate court rules in favor of TRN on $680 mln Guardrail case, removing a 2+ year overhang on the shares 
The stock jumped from $31 to $35 on this annonucement
The plaintiff could appeal to the supreme court but analysts say there`s a 1% chance the Supreme court will take the case given the ruling by the lower appellate court
This overhang had prevented the company from announcing any large buybacks or corporate actions
12/12/17 - TRN announces spin-off of infrastructure assets - to complete by 2H 2018
TRN also doubled its buyback authorization from 250-500 million

Trinity Industries, Inc. Announces Intention to Spin-off Companys Infrastructure-Related Businesses
www.businesswire.com
Trinity Industries, Inc. (NYSE: TRN) (Trinity) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of t

Company Description

Trinity operates in 5 reportable segments:



1) Railcar Leasing (~25% of EBIT)

Offers operating leases for tank and freight cars
Also provides management, maintenance, and administrative services to railcar customers.
Customers are railroads and industrial shippers. Terms can vary from one to twenty years
Comps
GATX is the best pure comp 
Other leasing companies that you could use are R, EFN, CAI
CIT has a rail leasing business that`s comparable
Usually valued on PE or Book value - GATX at 1.6x

2) Railcar Manufacturing (~ 50% of EBIT)

Manufactures freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting various cargo - box cars, gondola cars, intermodal, tank cars etc. Customers include all of the major Class 1 rails
The business is very cyclical and economically sensitive
Comps
GBX, ARII, and RAIL
GBX is the closest comp
Valued on EV/EBITDA

3) Construction Products (~12% of EBIT)

Manufactures highway products and steel products for infrastructure related projects (ie guardrails, crash cushions, protective barriers)
TRN also produces and distributes aggresgates, shale, clay, crushed stone, ashphalt
Aggregates make up about 40% of sales and an even higher % of EBIT
Concentrated in the western and south western USA
Comps
MLM, VMC, SUM, USCR
Valued on EV/EBITDA 

4) Energy Equipment (~9% of EBIT)

Manufactures wind towers, utility steel structures for electrical transmission, tank heads for pressure vessels, storage containers for oil, gas and chemical companies
Analysts believe this trades like an E&C company. It`s a commodity business
Comps
EC comps trade 6-10x EV/EBITDA - people think this would trade towards the lower ened

5) Inland Barge Group (~4% of EBIT)

Manufactures inland barges and barge covers. It also manufactures a variety of dry cargo barges that transport commodities like grain coal and aggregates
Comps
There are zero comps for this business

The company is spinning off the ""Infrastructure"" business (3,4,5) from the Railcar business (1,2). The rationale for the spin is likely that the company was pushed by activists and other shareholders to unlock the SOTP value. According to analysts, the company has always pitched that they are stronger as a diversified industrial company because of the cyclicality of the individual businesses. But the activist thesis is not new and analysts have talked about a break up for a while, arguing that the whole company traded at a discount to the SOTP.  Additionally, if you exclude the rail finance leasing debt, the company is net cash and underlevered. So there`s optionality for increased buybacks, acquisitions etc. 

What happens from here?

Rail business - 
The business is underlevered. Other rail leasing companies have 70% LTV while TRN has 30% LTV on its balance sheet. The company could be more aggressive
Acquisition
Could make an acquisition like 
Likely to see more financial focused investors buy the Rail business after the spin

Leasing business could take on substantially more leasing debt
Would help increase ROE on the fleet
Businesses are at trough 
Energy, railcars - seeing pick up in orders
Infrastructure spending
Could sell the aggregates business for a high and accretive multiple - to MLM of VMC - could fetch 13-15x
Rail business could improve leasing mix by acquiring ARII - Icahn owned - does Icahn want to exit?
Analysts say bulls believe that the company is low balling earnings for 2018
Sumitomo paid a huge multiple for a rail car leasing business 
Analysts say the uber Bulls have SOTP $50-60

What do Bears say

Traditionally they`ve been an acquirer and consolidator to diversify the business - Do they make a bad acquisition or go back to that model?
Infrastructure business could get dumped - it`s small and unlikely to attract a specific type of investor ...Reminds me of SPXC
Hard to sell the rail business
Natural buyers would be banks because of the leasing business, but unlikely that banks would want the manufacturing business
You also can`t separate the manufacturing business because of the cyclicality - in a downturn, it might night survive without the leasing business
Stock has run a lot - SOTP story is baked in
Weak management
All businesses are quite cyclical 
Downside mid-20s

Trinity Industries, Inc. Announces Intention to Spin-off Companys Infrastructure-Related Businesses
www.businesswire.com
Trinity Industries, Inc. (NYSE: TRN) (Trinity) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of t

Company Description

Trinity operates in 5 reportable segments:



1) Railcar Leasing (~25% of EBIT)

Offers operating leases for tank and freight cars
Also provides management, maintenance, and administrative services to railcar customers.
Customers are railroads and industrial shippers. Terms can vary from one to twenty years
Comps
GATX is the best pure comp 
Other leasing companies that you could use are R, EFN, CAI
CIT has a rail leasing business that`s comparable
Usually valued on PE or Book value - GATX at 1.6x

2) Railcar Manufacturing (~ 50% of EBIT)

Manufactures freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting various cargo - box cars, gondola cars, intermodal, tank cars etc. Customers include all of the major Class 1 rails
The business is very cyclical and economically sensitive
Comps
GBX, ARII, and RAIL
GBX is the closest comp
Valued on EV/EBITDA

3) Construction Products (~12% of EBIT)

Manufactures highway products and steel products for infrastructure related projects (ie guardrails, crash cushions, protective barriers)
TRN also produces and distributes aggresgates, shale, clay, crushed stone, ashphalt
Aggregates make up about 40% of sales and an even higher % of EBIT
Concentrated in the western and south western USA
Comps
MLM, VMC, SUM, USCR
Valued on EV/EBITDA 

4) Energy Equipment (~9% of EBIT)

Manufactures wind towers, utility steel structures for electrical transmission, tank heads for pressure vessels, storage containers for oil, gas and chemical companies
Analysts believe this trades like an E&C company. It`s a commodity business
Comps
EC comps trade 6-10x EV/EBITDA - people think this would trade towards the lower ened

5) Inland Barge Group (~4% of EBIT)

Manufactures inland barges and barge covers. It also manufactures a variety of dry cargo barges that transport commodities like grain coal and aggregates
Comps
There are zero comps for this business

The company is spinning off the ""Infrastructure"" business (3,4,5) from the Railcar business (1,2). The rationale for the spin is likely that the company was pushed by activists and other shareholders to unlock the SOTP value. According to analysts, the company has always pitched that they are stronger as a diversified industrial company because of the cyclicality of the individual businesses. But the activist thesis is not new and analysts have talked about a break up for a while, arguing that the whole company traded at a discount to the SOTP.  Additionally, if you exclude the rail finance leasing debt, the company is net cash and underlevered. So there`s optionality for increased buybacks, acquisitions etc. 

What happens from here?

Rail business - 
The business is underlevered. Other rail leasing companies have 70% LTV while TRN has 30% LTV on its balance sheet. The company could be more aggressive
Acquisition
Could make an acquisition like 
Likely to see more financial focused investors buy the Rail business after the spin

Infrastructure business
It`s still a hodge podge of random businesses that don`t make sense together
Management has not said which company they will go to but they are not well liked. Analysts say they should let someone else manage the rail business

Trinity Industries, Inc. Announces Intention to Spin-off Companys Infrastructure-Related Businesses
www.businesswire.com
Trinity Industries, Inc. (NYSE: TRN) (Trinity) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of t

Company Description

Trinity operates in 5 reportable segments:



1) Railcar Leasing (~25% of EBIT)

Offers operating leases for tank and freight cars
Also provides management, maintenance, and administrative services to railcar customers.
Customers are railroads and industrial shippers. Terms can vary from one to twenty years
Comps
GATX is the best pure comp 
Other leasing companies that you could use are R, EFN, CAI
CIT has a rail leasing business that`s comparable
Usually valued on PE or Book value - GATX at 1.6x

2) Railcar Manufacturing (~ 50% of EBIT)

Manufactures freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting various cargo - box cars, gondola cars, intermodal, tank cars etc. Customers include all of the major Class 1 rails
The business is very cyclical and economically sensitive
Comps
GBX, ARII, and RAIL
GBX is the closest comp
Valued on EV/EBITDA

3) Construction Products (~12% of EBIT)

Manufactures highway products and steel products for infrastructure related projects (ie guardrails, crash cushions, protective barriers)
TRN also produces and distributes aggresgates, shale, clay, crushed stone, ashphalt
Aggregates make up about 40% of sales and an even higher % of EBIT
Concentrated in the western and south western USA
Comps
MLM, VMC, SUM, USCR
Valued on EV/EBITDA 

4) Energy Equipment (~9% of EBIT)

Manufactures wind towers, utility steel structures for electrical transmission, tank heads for pressure vessels, storage containers for oil, gas and chemical companies
Analysts believe this trades like an E&C company. It`s a commodity business
Comps
EC comps trade 6-10x EV/EBITDA - people think this would trade towards the lower ened

5) Inland Barge Group (~4% of EBIT)

Manufactures inland barges and barge covers. It also manufactures a variety of dry cargo barges that transport commodities like grain coal and aggregates
Comps
There are zero comps for this business

The company is spinning off the ""Infrastructure"" business (3,4,5) from the Railcar business (1,2). The rationale for the spin is likely that the company was pushed by activists and other shareholders to unlock the SOTP value. According to analysts, the company has always pitched that they are stronger as a diversified industrial company because of the cyclicality of the individual businesses. But the activist thesis is not new and analysts have talked about a break up for a while, arguing that the whole company traded at a discount to the SOTP.  Additionally, if you exclude the rail finance leasing debt, the company is net cash and underlevered. So there`s optionality for increased buybacks, acquisitions etc. 

What happens from here?

Rail business - 
The business is underlevered. Other rail leasing companies have 70% LTV while TRN has 30% LTV on its balance sheet. The company could be more aggressive
Acquisition
Could make an acquisition like 
Likely to see more financial focused investors buy the Rail business after the spin

Infrastructure business
It`s still a hodge podge of random businesses that don`t make sense together
Management has not said which company they will go to but they are not well liked. Analysts say they should let someone else manage the rail business
IF management still wants to control a conglomerate and rebuild a new diversified industrial company, they could go to the spin-co
Sell the construction/ag business
VMC and MLM trade at more than 14x EBITDA and transaction multiples have been at all time highs. Some people believe they should take advantage of the market and sell these assets

Valuation

What do Bulls say:

underlevered - could buyback 25-50% of its stock overtime
Leasing business could take on substantially more leasing debt
Would help increase ROE on the fleet
Businesses are at trough 
Energy, railcars - seeing pick up in orders
Infrastructure spending
Could sell the aggregates business for a high and accretive multiple - to MLM of VMC - could fetch 13-15x
Rail business could improve leasing mix by acquiring ARII - Icahn owned - does Icahn want to exit?
Analysts say bulls believe that the company is low balling earnings for 2018
Sumitomo paid a huge multiple for a rail car leasing business 
Analysts say the uber Bulls have SOTP $50-60

What do Bears say

Traditionally they`ve been an acquirer and consolidator to diversify the business - Do they make a bad acquisition or go back to that model?
Infrastructure business could get dumped - it`s small and unlikely to attract a specific type of investor ...Reminds me of SPXC
Hard to sell the rail business
Natural buyers would be banks because of the leasing business, but unlikely that banks would want the manufacturing business
You also can`t separate the manufacturing business because of the cyclicality - in a downturn, it might night survive without the leasing business
Stock has run a lot - SOTP story is baked in
Weak management
All businesses are quite cyclical 
Downside mid-20s


SOTP

Citi: $21-69 (Bear/Bull valuation) - $45 average

Analyst uses trough and peak estimates per segment with trough and peak multiples - so these are sort of the extreme numbers





Wells Fargo: $35 / 47 / $56 - Bear/Base/Bull



Rail Business Value - $28, $36, $43 - Bear/Base/Bull

Using a discount to GATX on the leasing business with 1.2x book value as the base case
Using 4x/6x/8x Mulitple at the manufacturing business - ARII trades 8.4x and GBX trades 5.0x




Infrastructure Business Value - $7, $10, $13 - Bear/Base/Bull

2-4x on the barge business - Some analysts are higher at 5x
4-6x on the Construction business seems a bit low given 40% of the business is Ag which should trade at 13-14x
5-7x on the Energy business seems fair

The company is spinning off the ""Infrastructure"" business (3,4,5) from the Railcar business (1,2). The rationale for the spin is likely that the company was pushed by activists and other shareholders to unlock the SOTP value. According to analysts, the company has always pitched that they are stronger as a diversified industrial company because of the cyclicality of the individual businesses. But the activist thesis is not new and analysts have talked about a break up for a while, arguing that the whole company traded at a discount to the SOTP.  Additionally, if you exclude the rail finance leasing debt, the company is net cash and underlevered. So there`s optionality for increased buybacks, acquisitions etc. 

What happens from here?

Rail business - 
The business is underlevered. Other rail leasing companies have 70% LTV while TRN has 30% LTV on its balance sheet. The company could be more aggressive
Acquisition
Could make an acquisition like 
Likely to see more financial focused investors buy the Rail business after the spin

Infrastructure business
It`s still a hodge podge of random businesses that don`t make sense together
Management has not said which company they will go to but they are not well liked. Analysts say they should let someone else manage the rail business
IF management still wants to control a conglomerate and rebuild a new diversified industrial company, they could go to the spin-co
Sell the construction/ag business
VMC and MLM trade at more than 14x EBITDA and transaction multiples have been at all time highs. Some people believe they should take advantage of the market and sell these assets

Valuation

What do Bulls say:

underlevered - could buyback 25-50% of its stock overtime
Leasing business could take on substantially more leasing debt
Would help increase ROE on the fleet
Businesses are at trough 
Energy, railcars - seeing pick up in orders
Infrastructure spending
Could sell the aggregates business for a high and accretive multiple - to MLM of VMC - could fetch 13-15x
Rail business could improve leasing mix by acquiring ARII - Icahn owned - does Icahn want to exit?
Analysts say bulls believe that the company is low balling earnings for 2018
Sumitomo paid a huge multiple for a rail car leasing business 
Analysts say the uber Bulls have SOTP $50-60

What do Bears say

Traditionally they`ve been an acquirer and consolidator to diversify the business - Do they make a bad acquisition or go back to that model?
Infrastructure business could get dumped - it`s small and unlikely to attract a specific type of investor ...Reminds me of SPXC
Hard to sell the rail business
Natural buyers would be banks because of the leasing business, but unlikely that banks would want the manufacturing business
You also can`t separate the manufacturing business because of the cyclicality - in a downturn, it might night survive without the leasing business
Stock has run a lot - SOTP story is baked in
Weak management
All businesses are quite cyclical 
Downside mid-20s

Situation Overview

7/29/16 - ValueAct reports 13D stake in TRN
9/29/17 - Appelate court rules in favor of TRN on $680 mln Guardrail case, removing a 2+ year overhang on the shares 
The stock jumped from $31 to $35 on this annonucement
The plaintiff could appeal to the supreme court but analysts say there`s a 1% chance the Supreme court will take the case given the ruling by the lower appellate court
This overhang had prevented the company from announcing any large buybacks or corporate actions
12/12/17 - TRN announces spin-off of infrastructure assets - to complete by 2H 2018
TRN also doubled its buyback authorization from 250-500 million

The company going from <2x leverage to 5x leverage and while they didnt seem fussed about anti-trust, they werent willing to deep dive on the synergies, until the deal has closed.  Dont think this can trade on P/E or FCF yield given the big step up in leverage and if deal closes, not likely until year end.  This appears to be a 3 to 2 in US and LATAM markets.

EV/EBITDA multiples vs. peers suggest a range of 8.6 to 10.4x.  Using a discount rate of 10%, puts upside around $64.
If done on FCF yield, but assuming a bigger required return (discount rate) of 20%, then you can move to ~$73.50. 
Downside around $50 seems about right.

On January 12, Bloomberg reported that DE Shaw is building an activist stake (estimated at 1bn) in LOW. On January 19, 2018, LOW nominated 3 independent board directors after constructive talks with DE Shaw. 
The three board directors are: 
* Davide Batchelder: Co Founder of Relational Investors, who was activist and sat on the board of Home Depot in the early 2000s
* Lisa Wardell: CEO of Adtalem Global Education
* Brian Rogers: Chairman of T Rowe Price (last year all PMs withheld votes for the existing board)

It seems DE Shaw has been presenting its case to the sell side since late last year. 

Their thesis is as follows:
* LOW has a 500bp EBIT margin differential and 30% less sales per sq ft compared to HD
* Their research indicates that HD enjoys no structural advantage to LOW and LOWs operating metrics should be very similar to HD
	* Reviewed census data on per store basis and have very similar demographics
* Revenue opportunities
	* Online: 3bn opportunity and should be a quick fix
		* Needs to revamp the website 
		* HD has 67% more products online
		* Purchasing online on LOW vs HD is slower
	* Pro Market Opportunity:
		* Pros visit stores more often and spend more per visit than retail customers
		* Service is poorer at LOW vs HD
		* Delivery (same day / next day) is available at HD but not at LOW so more convenient
		* Inventory is thinner and not always in stock 
	* In Store Experience: will likely take the longest
		* Need to improve the SKU selection
		* HD is more regionally / locally focused when stocking SKUs vs LOW which does it at the corporate level
* Cost Cutting
	* Shipping and Handling: LOWs shipping and handling is 40% higher than HD (200-300mm)
		* HD has vendors ship directly to customers while LOWs ships from vendor to DC / store then to customer (extra step)
	* Labor (100-200mm)
		* LOW is 60% FT and 40% PT while HD is the opposite
			* Therefore labor is less flexible
		* LOW has 3x of store managers per store than HD
		* Corporate employees per dollar of sales is greater at LOW
* When the management team executes these things, the multiple should rerate in line with HD similar to  in 2014
* Strong industry tailwinds
	* Not Amazonable and growing MSD as an industry
	* Only two major national players vs mom and pops so pricing should be stable and rational

Risks to the Upside:
* Consensus biggest issue is that as interest rates increases multiples for hardlines tend to come in drastically and hurts fundamentals as people tend to do less renos and new builds
* Execution risk to the turnaround; while the bull case seems simple, we have seen this in stories like AAP before and it always takes longer than expected
* AMZN could enter the appliance business


General Benchmarking Comments for Q1`18 Print:
* We know Q1 will have a slow start due to weather
* Historically, HD has outperformed LOW by 2% in Q1
* Given commentary management made with regards to overstocking for the Spring that arrived late, would seem to indicate that Q1 could be worse than historical
* HD reported 4.2% noting weather was weak - assuming 3.5% differential implies LOW SSS will come in around 0.60bps for Q1
* Given the lower sales figure, there is likely to be operating deleverage. However, looking at historical Q1, LOW has actually outperformed on gross margins vs LOW, even in the quarters where Spring came late
* Since LOW reported 34.5% gross margins, to be conservative, we assume 34.3% (i.e. worse than historical)
* For SG&A, Q1`17 was the largest differential where LOW`s SG&A came in 4.7% higher on a % of sales basis
* Assuming the same drag vs HD`s reported 19.2% SG&A as % of sales figure, LOW`s SG&A could be as high as 23.9% of sales

		* LOW is 60% FT and 40% PT while HD is the opposite
			* Therefore labor is less flexible
		* LOW has 3x of store managers per store than HD
		* Corporate employees per dollar of sales is greater at LOW
* When the management team executes these things, the multiple should rerate in line with HD similar to  in 2014
* Strong industry tailwinds
	* Not Amazonable and growing MSD as an industry
	* Only two major national players vs mom and pops so pricing should be stable and rational

Risks to the Upside:
* Consensus biggest issue is that as interest rates increases multiples for hardlines tend to come in drastically and hurts fundamentals as people tend to do less renos and new builds
* Execution risk to the turnaround; while the bull case seems simple, we have seen this in stories like AAP before and it always takes longer than expected
* AMZN could enter the appliance business


General Benchmarking Comments for Q1`18 Print:
* We know Q1 will have a slow start due to weather
* Historically, HD has outperformed LOW by 2% in Q1
* Given commentary management made with regards to overstocking for the Spring that arrived late, would seem to indicate that Q1 could be worse than historical
* HD reported 4.2% noting weather was weak - assuming 3.5% differential implies LOW SSS will come in around 0.60bps for Q1
* Given the lower sales figure, there is likely to be operating deleverage. However, looking at historical Q1, LOW has actually outperformed on gross margins vs LOW, even in the quarters where Spring came late
* Since LOW reported 34.5% gross margins, to be conservative, we assume 34.3% (i.e. worse than historical)
* For SG&A, Q1`17 was the largest differential where LOW`s SG&A came in 4.7% higher on a % of sales basis
* Assuming the same drag vs HD`s reported 19.2% SG&A as % of sales figure, LOW`s SG&A could be as high as 23.9% of sales

On January 12, Bloomberg reported that DE Shaw is building an activist stake (estimated at 1bn) in LOW. On January 19, 2018, LOW nominated 3 independent board directors after constructive talks with DE Shaw. 
The three board directors are: 
* Davide Batchelder: Co Founder of Relational Investors, who was activist and sat on the board of Home Depot in the early 2000s
* Lisa Wardell: CEO of Adtalem Global Education
* Brian Rogers: Chairman of T Rowe Price (last year all PMs withheld votes for the existing board)

It seems DE Shaw has been presenting its case to the sell side since late last year. 

Their thesis is as follows:
* LOW has a 500bp EBIT margin differential and 30% less sales per sq ft compared to HD
* Their research indicates that HD enjoys no structural advantage to LOW and LOWs operating metrics should be very similar to HD
	* Reviewed census data on per store basis and have very similar demographics
* Revenue opportunities
	* Online: 3bn opportunity and should be a quick fix
		* Needs to revamp the website 
		* HD has 67% more products online
		* Purchasing online on LOW vs HD is slower
	* Pro Market Opportunity:
		* Pros visit stores more often and spend more per visit than retail customers
		* Service is poorer at LOW vs HD
		* Delivery (same day / next day) is available at HD but not at LOW so more convenient
		* Inventory is thinner and not always in stock 
	* In Store Experience: will likely take the longest
		* Need to improve the SKU selection
		* HD is more regionally / locally focused when stocking SKUs vs LOW which does it at the corporate level
* Cost Cutting

At 4.25x which is GCI excluding pension is 12.36

GCI including underfunded pension is 5.6x and would imply $15.11

the other way around is TPCO trough multiple is 3.5x on their adjusted EBITDA.  They`ve guided to 109mm of adjusted ebitda which would get you to $12.93

For completeness, 3.5x on 85mm of EBITDA is $10.56

My downside before was 11.83; but GCI multiple up 0.25x since last time moves numbers, so i`m re-calibrating to $12, which is just a touch up and really just a rounding up to reflect better GCI multiple","Rumored prices in the press - Donereail in the low 18s; (we assume $18.25.  Latest NYP suggested a range of $18.25 to $19 and we assume MNI needs to beat Donerail

On my numbers 2019 EBITDA at MNI will be 99.5m and at TPCO 85mm and believe there`s 100mm of synergies at 10% of TPCO top line.

GCI trades at 4.25x 2019 EBITDA.  

I assume Chatham Xchanges their 351mm of term loan 50% for equity at last price ($6.85) and then 19.5% of their TL into a convertible preferred; which in total would keep them flat on their PnL from entry point on the credit.

I assume Soon-Shiong rolls his equity stake.
I assume MNI uses 100mm of the 123mm TPCO cash balance for shareholders

At an 18.25 deal that equates to 237mm of new debt raised and 150mm of equity given to TPCO shareholders, which at last price would be a 0.62 ratio and $14 cash.

That equates to PF gross debt of 722, Minority interest at 39mm and cash at 43mm.  PF s/o would be 78.6mm before Chatam convert (i included the face value of their convert in the gross debt).

at 4.25x of 284.2mm in EBITDA i get to $6.22 pro-forma MNI value; which at 0.62 ratio and $14 cash would be $17.86

Worst case at 4.25x only 250mm of EBITDA, assuming the synergies take time to ramp; and Soon-shiong doesn`t roll equity (meaning less cash for minority TPCO holders) MNI would be worth $4.37 and TPCO implied deal is $15.09.  In this scenario deal terms are $9.50 cash and 1.28 shares.  The total s/o don`t change, just your mix of cash/stock

At an 18.25 deal that equates to 237mm of new debt raised and 150mm of equity given to TPCO shareholders, which at last price would be a 0.62 ratio and $14 cash.

U.S. utility may launch post-Labor Day review

By Victor Kremer

El Paso Electric Co., a regulated utility with a service territory in Texas and New Mexico, is said to be considering launching a formal strategic review after the Labor Day holiday. 

The utility engaged Lazard earlier this year after receiving an unsolicited acquisition approach, according to industry sources. 

News of the unsolicited approach from an unidentified third party was first reported by SparkSpread on May 3. 

A spokesman for El Paso Electric declined comment. 

A spokeswoman for Lazard did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 

On an earnings call last week, El Paso Electric executives twice avoided direct questions from analysts about a potential M&A transaction. 

Mary Kipp, El Paso Electrics ceo, responding to a question from an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said the company would not comment on whether it had retained an advisor. 

After a subsequent question about M&A rumors from an analyst at ExodusPoint Capital, Kipp again declined comment, beyond saying El Paso Electrics board would  consider any such proposal. I believe it would be in the best interest of our shareholders and customers, but we also remain confident in our standalone plan. 

El Paso Electric currently serves 417,000 retail and wholesale customers in a 10,000 square mile area of the Rio Grande valley in west Texas and southern New Mexico, according to the companys website. 

The utility traces its roots to 1901, when it started serving customers as El Paso Electric Railway Co. 

Discussion with Mizuho Desk Analyst:

- 1 of 2 utilities that has high load growth ~2%
- having a hard time keeping up with capex needs of service territory. Pushed out other capex items and now playing catch up
- will likely need equity raise in 2019-2020 period
- would be better in the hands of a bigger utility with a bigger balance sheet
- Texas is a good operating environment, New Mexico - not so much
- CEO is highly respected and knows the regulators well - she came in and turned around EE a few years back
- Algonquin has told ppl on the road that they were interested but one hurdle was getting Mary Kipp to move to Canada, which she did not want to do
- IRP taking place and will examine 2020-2021 - there will be a large step up in earnings in 2021
- Thinks deal could be 24-25x similar to what AVA was paid
- Fair value is probably low 50s

Mizuho Analyst

- Hard to see a big premium to where it`s trading today (high 50s)
- Mostly texas
- Private equity less like with new tax law
- EE is an attractive M&A take-out candidate given the lack of a holding company, above average utility load growth in EEs largest service territory, runway for additional capital spend outside of the current RFP, and need for equity issuance in 2019/2020 time period.


","Prior to the Sparkspread article, EE traded at ~0.8x premium to the peer average of 19.1x

Over the last 3 years, EE has traded at a 0.15x average.

Using Mizuho 2019 EE EPS, this range would get yield:

20.45x (0.15x premium) = $49.31

21.3x (0.8x premium) $2.41 = $50.88

","- AVA being bought for 26.5 NTM PE
- Last 3 deals in the space have seen 24-26.5x range

Using this range on $2.41 2019 EPS equates to:

26.5 x $2.41 = $63.8555

24 x $2.41  = $57.8

~$61 mid point

Quick combo with AQN suggests that it would have to be an all stock deal due to leverage and it would be dilutive

U.S. utility may launch post-Labor Day review

By Victor Kremer

El Paso Electric Co., a regulated utility with a service territory in Texas and New Mexico, is said to be considering launching a formal strategic review after the Labor Day holiday. 

The utility engaged Lazard earlier this year after receiving an unsolicited acquisition approach, according to industry sources. 

News of the unsolicited approach from an unidentified third party was first reported by SparkSpread on May 3. 

A spokesman for El Paso Electric declined comment. 

A spokeswoman for Lazard did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 

On an earnings call last week, El Paso Electric executives twice avoided direct questions from analysts about a potential M&A transaction. 

Mary Kipp, El Paso Electrics ceo, responding to a question from an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said the company would not comment on whether it had retained an advisor. 

After a subsequent question about M&A rumors from an analyst at ExodusPoint Capital, Kipp again declined comment, beyond saying El Paso Electrics board would  consider any such proposal. I believe it would be in the best interest of our shareholders and customers, but we also remain confident in our standalone plan. 

El Paso Electric currently serves 417,000 retail and wholesale customers in a 10,000 square mile area of the Rio Grande valley in west Texas and southern New Mexico, according to the companys website. 

The utility traces its roots to 1901, when it started serving customers as El Paso Electric Railway Co. 

Discussion with Mizuho Desk Analyst:

- 1 of 2 utilities that has high load growth ~2%
- having a hard time keeping up with capex needs of service territory. Pushed out other capex items and now playing catch up
- will likely need equity raise in 2019-2020 period
- would be better in the hands of a bigger utility with a bigger balance sheet
- Texas is a good operating environment, New Mexico - not so much
- CEO is highly respected and knows the regulators well - she came in and turned around EE a few years back
- Algonquin has told ppl on the road that they were interested but one hurdle was getting Mary Kipp to move to Canada, which she did not want to do
- IRP taking place and will examine 2020-2021 - there will be a large step up in earnings in 2021
- Thinks deal could be 24-25x similar to what AVA was paid
- Fair value is probably low 50s

Mizuho Analyst

- Hard to see a big premium to where it`s trading today (high 50s)
- Mostly texas
- Private equity less like with new tax law
- EE is an attractive M&A take-out candidate given the lack of a holding company, above average utility load growth in EEs largest service territory, runway for additional capital spend outside of the current RFP, and need for equity issuance in 2019/2020 time period.


","Prior to the Sparkspread article, EE traded at ~0.8x premium to the peer average of 19.1x

Over the last 3 years, EE has traded at a 0.15x average.

Using Mizuho 2019 EE EPS, this range would get yield:

On September 12, 2018, Marathon amended its 13D indicating they had a 8.5% of share outstanding. They recommended that the Company cut SG&A especially as it relates to executive compensation which is higher than most peers to boost margins and cease acquisitions. Alternatively the Company should consider a sale of the Company through a competitive auction if they are not willing to change their strategy. 
Furthermore, Marathon also indicated that they should replace the TPG Board members given they only own 30% of the shares outstanding. This seems more like a turnaround story than a sale in my opinion.

Conclusion: this seems more like a turnaround play than a take out. This one isnt really particularly interesting from a event perspective in my opinion.

assuming a further premium vs. current AEL share price. However, ATH would likely
have the most to gain from expense synergies (not to mention distribution expansion
and potential tax benefits). FG, on the other hand, has ~$400m of deployable capital,

	In December 2017, WSC acquired a smaller player called Acton, providing the first roll-up target
	In June 2018, WSC announced it would acquire ModSpace for $1.1B in cash, stock and warrants
o	ModSpace is the old modular space business that was acquired by Resun Corp from GE in 2007
o	The transaction is expected to close in the 3Q of 2018. All antitrust approvals have been secured 
o	The transaction is expected to generate $60M in cost synergies and provide further opportunity for WSC to overlay their VAPS offering to ModSpaces fleet thereby creating incremental revenue synergies

Corporate Overview
	WSC is a specialty rental services market leader providing innovative modular space and portable storage solutions across 
	WSC was formed through the acquisition of Algeco Scottsmans North American modular space business by Double Eagle Acquisition Corp in late 2017 for $1.1B
o	In effect, Algeco would reverse IPO their North American business through the SPAC, after which the SPAC would be re-named William Scottsman and trade under the WSC ticker
o	Note Algeco, owned by a European PE shop called TDR Capital, had originally acquired the same North American in 2007 for $2.2B at what was then an 8x EBITDA multiple (old ticker is WLSC)
	The general thesis for owning the SPAC and WSC has been:
o	Core business was strong but was capital constrained being a part of Algeco which was more levered
o	Market is fragmented and this could be a platform to roll-up smaller players
o	WSC was in the process rolling out its new Value Added Products & Services (VAPS) offering (essentially providing higher margin furnishings to the modular offices) that would drive pricing and margin higher
o	Multiple differential between its closest peer, Mobile Mini (MINI) was over 2x EBITDA and that multiple should converge over time
",Core WSC at 8x including 60mm in synergies = $11.84 undiscounted or $10.96 on PV basis,"Bull Thesis on WSC
1.	First, bulls believe WSC should trade in-line with MINI over time. MINI currently trades at 12.5x vs WSC that traded at 10x prior to the deal announcement
2.	$60M in cost synergies would create significant value given it would represent 21% of both companies combined EBITDA to
3.	Incremental revenue synergies attainable by rolling out VAPS not only across legacy WSC fleet, but also across the Acton (acquired late last year) and ModSpace fleets. In the deal presentation, management alluded to potential $125M+ in revenue upside from the 3 combinations over a 3-5 year period:day. Assuming the full $138M in future revenue potential was achieved within 3 years (bulls say contracts turnover approximately 35 months, so in 3 years the full revenue synergies could be achieved) this would imply approximately $110M in incremental EBITDA by 2021.
4.	Bringing ModSpaces fleet utilization in the mid-60% range on parity to WSCs mid-70% would generate an incremental $28M EBITDA by 2021
5.	Combining all together and adjusting for warrant dilution would imply a range between $18-$20

Between those prices, RAMP can acquire between 10.2M and 11.2M shares, representing a buyback of approximately 12.9% to 14.3% of total shares. The board has also approved an additional $500M authorization to its buyback but has noted this will be used to offset stock-based compensation that is expected to move higher.

Based on our analysis, there is a high likelihood of at least 75% of shares being accepted into the tender. Our current analysis suggests the tender clearing price could be north of $48/share. Fundamentally, relative to peer multiples today, we see RAMP as being reasonably worth between $48-$53/share, but see a worst-case downside of $38/share. As such, our recommendation is to own RAMP into the tender with no conversions and a potential small basket of peers representing our potential back-end exposure.
